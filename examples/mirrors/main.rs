What this controller reacts to and what it does about it. Generated from the
declarations, so it cannot drift from the code — regenerate with
`cargo run --example mirrors`.

## Features

Stateless features, one per file, each declaring what it handles and emits.

{table}
## Events, features and actions

```mermaid
{flow}```

## Folding

Folding and unfolding are observable states, so this one is a state machine.

```mermaid
{diagram}```

## Checks

| Events nothing handles | {unhandled:?} |
| Holes in the fold table | {holes:?} |
| Fold table is clean | {clean} |
