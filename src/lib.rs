//! A declarative controller framework.
//!
//! A controller declares what it reacts to and what it does about it as static
//! data. Execution, diagram generation and exhaustive gap checking are all
//! derived from that one declaration, so it is the only place the logic lives.
//!
//! # Layers
//!
//! | Module | For |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`feature`] | Controllers with no states: what each feature reacts to and emits |
//! | [`machine`] | Controllers with states: a transition table and its executor |
//! | [`render`] | Diagrams and gap reports derived from either declaration |
//!
//! [`Domain`] bundles the types a controller works with and is shared by both
//! layers, so a feature that grows states keeps the same declaration. It holds
//! two effect vocabularies: [`Domain::Action`] for reactions to an event, and
//! [`Domain::StateAction`] for entry and exit effects, which never see one.
//!
//! # Declaration macros
//!
//! | Macro | Generates |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`tags!`] | State tag enum + [`Enumerable`] |
//! | [`events!`] | Event enum + kind enum + [`HasKind`] + [`Enumerable`] |
//! | [`cond_node!`] | A [`machine::CondNode`] impl |
//! | [`check!`] | A guard [`machine::Expr`] tree |
